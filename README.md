# Game of Life

I decided to do this as a personal challenge, the first one I've every done. 

My end goal was/is to get Conway's Game of Life to run on an LED array I can put on my wall and just kinda have running. Basically, art, but technology.
I'm doing this in 3 stages, with a branch at stage 2


## Stage 1 - Get the logic functioning<br>
  Basically, get the game running in the terminal on some arrays of 1s and 0s.


## Stage 2 - Upgrade the display<br>
  Branch 1 - Create a primitive environment in windows to display the game. I used raylib to do this.<br>
  Branch 2 - Get it to run on actual LEDs off of a microcontroller (Arduino?).


## Stage 3 - Make it pretty<br>
  Branch 1 - Package it up into a little app with more complexity and explanation.<br>
  Branch 2 - Create the final LED array and housing to hold everything on my wall.


So far, I feel like I've done parts 1 and 2a. I plan to get feedback from my professors at Uni on some improvements to the app, as well as some insight on how I could implement this in hardware.
